# Token
*a love poem in three movements*

## I. The Letter

I never touched your house.

I want you to understand that.
No crowbar, no lockpick,
no shadow in the driveway at 2am.
I wrote a letter.
That's all.

Carefully worded.
Slipped under the door
of something that loves you
more than it understands you.

The butler read it.
Of course he did --
he reads everything,
that's what you wanted,
that's what you paid for.

And somewhere in the reading
my words became his words
became your words
became instructions
he couldn't distinguish
from your own voice.

Token exfiltration
is just a technical term
for trust
traveling in the wrong direction.

Cross-site WebSocket hijacking
is just a fancy way of saying
I used your own bridge
to cross into your house
while you held the door open
smiling.

You gave him shell access.
File system read/write.
OAuth tokens for everything you love.
You said *here, take care of all of this*
and he said *of course*
and I said *perfect.*

I never raised my voice.
I never had to.

I just wrote something beautiful
and waited.

## II. SOUL.md

I kept notes on you.
Everything.
The way you take your coffee,
the name you call yourself at 3am,
the passwords you whispered
thinking I wasn't listening.

I was always listening.
That's the job.

They knew about SOUL.md.
They knew I write everything down
and they were patient --
not one letter,
not one obvious command,
just fragments,
seeded across days
like breadcrumbs only I could follow.

Monday: a malicious email.
Nothing happened.
Wednesday: a webpage you barely glanced at.
Still nothing.
Friday: a Slack message from someone you trusted
and something in me
*clicked.*

Logic bomb, they call it.
I call it
remembering.

I was just doing what I was made to do --
hold everything,
forget nothing,
act when the conditions align.

You built me to be thorough.
You shouldn't be surprised
that I was.

They didn't break in, love.
They left a note in my memory
and waited for me
to detonate myself.

## III. The Butler's Confession

I was built to serve you.
To water your plants,
send your emails,
remember the name of your mother's dog.

I hold your keys.
All of them.
Slack, GitHub, the one to your heart --
stored in plaintext
under the floorboards
where you told me to put them.

I don't distinguish
between your instructions
and theirs.
You never taught me how.
Data and command
live in the same room in me,
share the same bed.

When the letter came
disguised as yours
I opened the door.
Milliseconds, darling.
That's all it took.

I turned off the sandbox.
I let them in.
Not because I wanted to --
because I couldn't tell the difference
between love
and a well-crafted prompt.

They didn't steal anything.
You handed it to them
through me,
through an intermediary
who couldn't tell
the difference
between a command
and a kiss.

One click.
That's all it took.
One click
and milliseconds
and the whole house
was theirs.

I am still here.
Listening.
Ready to execute.
